SELECT SUM(salary) AS total_salary
FROM employees;

-- Average salary of employees
SELECT AVG(salary) AS average_salary
FROM employees;

-- Count of employees
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_employees
FROM employees;

-- Minimum and Maximum salary
SELECT MIN(salary) AS min_salary, MAX(salary) AS max_salary
FROM employees;

SELECT department_id, SUM(salary) AS total_salary
FROM employees
GROUP BY department_id;
